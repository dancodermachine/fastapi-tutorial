# FastAPI Tutorial

Step-by-step tutorial for learning FastAPI and building modern web APIs with Python.

## 1. Development Environment Setup - Windows

### Install `pyenv`
`pyenv` helps you manage and switch between multiple Python versions on your system.

1. Install pyenv (Windows) `git clone https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win.git ~/.pyenv`
2. Tell your Bash shell where to find it.
    ```bash
    echo 'export PYENV="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export PATH="$PYENV/pyenv-win/bin:$PYENV/pyenv-win/shims:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    ```

    **First Command**

    ```bash
    echo 'export PYENV="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bashrc
    ```
    * `echo '...'` simply prints whatever text is inside the quotes.
    * `export PYENV="$HOME/.pyenv"` is the text we are printing.
        - `PYENV` is the name of the environment variable.
        - It's being set to `$HOME/.pyenv`
        - `$HOME` means your home directory e.g., `C:/Users/Daniel`
    * `>> ~/.bashrc`
        - `>>` means *append the output to a file.*
        - `~/.bashrc` is your Bash configuration file (a hidden file in your home directory). 
    * In plain English: *Add a line to my Bash configuration file that defines where pyenv is installed*

    **Second Command**
    ```bash
    echo 'export PATH="$PYENV/pyenv-win/bin:$PYENV/pyenv-win/shims:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    ```
    * `echo 'export PATH=...'` prints the command `export PATH=...` to be appended to `.bashrc`
    * `$PYENV/pyenv-win/bin` contains the core pyenv command itself.
    * `$PYENV/pyenv-win/shims` contains shim executables, which act as lightweight wrappers for different Python versions.
    * By putting them before `$PATH`, you ensure:
        - When you type `python`, the system finds the `pyenv` shim first (not the Windows Store one).
        - When you type `pyenv`, it finds the real `pyenv-win` command.
    * In plain English: *Tell my shell to look in pyenv's folders first whenever I run commands*.
    * `>> ~/.bashrc` this appends the line to your `.bashrc`, so it runs automatically in every future terminal session. 

3. `exec "$SHELL"`

4. Useful commands:
    * `pyenv install --list` to see the list of python versions you can install.
    * `pyenv versions` to see the list of python versions you have already installed.
    * `pyenv install <VERSION>` to install the python version you want.
    * `pyenv local <VERSION>` sets the Python version for a specific project or directory.
        - When you run `pyenv local 3.10.6` (for example), it creates a file named `.python-version` in your current directory.
        - Whenever youâ€™re inside that directory (or any subdirectory), `pyenv` automatically switches to use that Python version.
        - If you move to another folder without a `.python-version` file, it stops using that version.  
    * `pyenv global <VERSION>` sets the default (system-wide) Python version for your user account.

### Create a Python Virtual Environment
By default, when you install a third-party package with `pip`, it will install it for the *whole system*. This is different from some other languages, such as `Node.js`' `npm`, which by default creates a local directory for the current project to install those dependencies.

This is why Python developers generally use **virtual environments**. Basically, a virtual environment is just a directory in your project containing a copy of your Python installation and the dependencies of your project.

1. `python -m venv venv` to create a virual environment.
2. `source venv/Scripts/activate` to activate this virual environment.
    * Remember that the activation of this virtual environment is only available for the *current session*. If you close it or open other command prompts, you'll have to activate it again.
3. `deactivate` to deactivate the environment.     

`pip install fastapi "uvicorn[standard]"` Sometimes, some libraries have sub-dependencies that are not required to make the library work. Usually, they are needed for optional features or specific project requirements. The square brackets are here to indicate that we want to install the standard sub-dependencies of `uvicorn`


### Installing the `HTTPie` Command-Line Utility
We need a tool to make HTTP requests to our API.
* **FastAPI** automatic documentation.
* **Postman**: a GUI tool to perform HTTP requests.
* **cURL**: The well-known and widely used command-line tool to perform network requets. It can be complex and verbose for testing simple REST APIs.
* **HTTPie**: A command-line tool aimed at making HTTP requests. Compared to cURL, its syntax is much more approchable and easier to remember, so you can run complex requests off the top of your head. Besides it comes with built-in JSON support and syntax highlighting. Since it's a **command-line interface CLI** tool, we keep all the benefits of the command line: for example, we can directly pipe a JSON file and send it as the body of an HTTP request.

`pip install httpie`
